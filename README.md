Whether you're a beginner or an expert in image manipulation, this project provides a versatile toolkit for filtering images.

## Techs
__Python__ techs as:
- **[Tkinter]** for GUI 
- **[Pillow]** for images manipulation
- **OOP**


## Features

- **Diverse Filters**: Apply various filters such as 
    - Convolutional
    - Morphological
    - Dithering
    - Character Filters
    - And more
- **Customization**: Fine-tune filter parameters to achieve specific visual effects.
- **Real-time Preview**: See immediate changes as you adjust filters for an interactive experience.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Work seamlessly with popular image formats including JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface design for effortless image manipulation.


## Installation

To explore and utilize the capabilities of the Image Filtering Project, follow these installation instructions:

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install the python libraries required also in __requirements.txt__.:

- [Tkinter]
- [Pillow]

With the following commands:
```sh
pip install tkinter
```

```sh
pip install pillow
```

and run the python script with (in their directory):
```sh
python <filter-project>.py
```
__OR__

If you are using a Linux system

3. Choose a python executable and launch the filter application just executing it.

```sh
./<filter-project>
```

## Usage
1. Load an image from your local storage.
2. Select your desired filter from the provided options.
3. Adjust filter parameters to fine-tune the effect, if needed.
4. Preview the filtered image in real-time.
5. Save the filtered image to your preferred location.
